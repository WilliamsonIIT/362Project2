# 362Project2

Overall, I think think that the project went well, I feel that our website is appealing and is a significant change to how the original page looked. I feel that 361 and 362 have given me a great foundation of web development as well as the tools to be able to utilize the skills I've learned in my future career. I'm very pleased with what I have learned and will continue to explore more in-depth web design concepts.
